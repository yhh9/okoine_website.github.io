				<p> We are always late in realizing the important things. Learning is a life-long process about knowledge that is connected and linked together. Education does not provide us with the passion to pursuit this process, it fails in its single
					most important mission: To Motivate.<br> We believe that its failure is not about the education itself but about the technologies they use. We believe that knowledge is interlinked and the present system fails to recognise it. We
                                        believe in a better way to learn and to teach knowledge.</p><br>
